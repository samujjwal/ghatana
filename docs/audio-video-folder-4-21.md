**Audited Root:** `/home/samujjwal/Developments/ghatana/products/audio-video`  
**Generated File:** `/home/samujjwal/Developments/ghatana/docs/audio-video-folder-4-21.md`  
**Audit Date:** 2026-04-21  
**Auditor Context:** Comprehensive product-review-prompt.md audit with test hardening focus

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Status: **PARTIAL / NOT READY** ⚠️

The Audio-Video product is a **reference implementation** for product boundary hygiene (per OWNER.md, 8/10 audit score) but exhibits critical completeness, observability, and test coverage gaps that prevent production deployment without significant hardening.

### Critical Blockers (P0)

1. **Stub implementations in core domain logic** — `WhisperTranscriptionEngine` is fully deprecated with `UnsupportedOperationException`, forcing reliance on external LLM fallback. Actual Whisper ONNX/JNI integration missing.
2. **Missing integration tests across module boundaries** — No tests validating gRPC service chains, database persistence with service layer async wrapping, message queue integration, or end-to-end transcription workflows.
3. **Incomplete observability instrumentation** — gRPC services use `SimpleMeterRegistry` (in-memory, non-persistent), no structured logging for critical flows, no distributed tracing setup, missing health checks beyond basic liveness.
4. **Test coverage gaps in persistence layer** — Repository tests exist but lack coverage for transaction boundaries, soft delete correctness, query performance under load, concurrent updates, and recovery scenarios.
5. **Missing feature implementation contracts** — Desktop app (Tauri + React) has `package.json` but no documented API contracts with backend services; TypeScript libraries lack schema validation at boundaries.
6. **AI/ML safety and observability absent** — Vision module uses OpenCV with YOLO but lacks evaluation datasets, model versioning, hallucination handling, confidence thresholds, and fallback behavior.

### High Priority Gaps (P1)

1. **Test authentication and authorization** — Security interceptor exists but no tests verify JWT validation, tenant isolation at gRPC boundary, permission enforcement, or token expiration handling.
2. **Multimodal integration undefined** — `multimodal-service` module exists but functionality not documented; no tests validating cross-module data flow (audio + vision + speech in single request).
3. **Performance and scalability untested** — No load tests for concurrent transcription jobs, no benchmarks for vision model inference latency, no stress tests for database persistence under high throughput.
4. **Missing cache correctness validation** — `AudioVideoCache` wraps platform cache but no tests verify key scoping, TTL behavior, invalidation on soft delete, or multi-tenant isolation.
5. **Messaging integration incomplete** — `TranscriptionJobProducer/Consumer` exist but lack integration tests with RabbitMQ, no tests for job idempotency, retry logic, or poison pill handling.
6. **Desktop app lacks comprehensive E2E tests** — Tauri app has Playwright configured but no documented E2E scenarios; missing user journey tests for record-transcribe-playback flows.

### Repeated Anti-Patterns

- **Stub implementations shipped as production code** — `WhisperTranscriptionEngine` throws `UnsupportedOperationException` with helpful message but no alternative implementation path documented.
- **Mock-heavy unit tests without integration validation** — Repositories tested in isolation but not with actual database and transaction handling.
- **Missing contracts at service boundaries** — gRPC proto files not audited; no schema validation for API responses.
- **Limited observability for domain logic** — Business metrics (transcription accuracy, latency, model inference time) not instrumented.

## 1. Repository-Wide Findings

### 1.1 Architecture & Boundary Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clean product boundary separation from platform (uses platform:java:* modules correctly)
- ✅ Polyglot build system (Java/Gradle, TypeScript/PNPM, Rust/Cargo) properly coordinated
- ✅ Tenant isolation enforced at SQL query level (all `AudioFile*` queries filter by `tenantId`)
- ✅ Platform conventions followed (no Spring, plain JPA, ActiveJ Promise patterns in service layer)
- ✅ Infrastructure layer separation (persistence, security, cache, messaging modularized)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Stub implementations in core services** — Real Whisper engine replaced with deterministic stubs
- ❌ **No cross-module integration tests** — Each service tested in isolation, not with actual dependencies
- ❌ **Incomplete multimodal contract** — Speech, vision, intelligence modules exist but no unified API definition
- ❌ **Missing operational contracts** — No SLO/SLA documentation, no health check specs, no graceful degradation patterns

### 1.2 Correctness & Completeness

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Persistence Layer** | PARTIAL | Entities proper, repositories sync per AEP pattern, but soft delete not validated in tests |
| **Security Layer** | INCOMPLETE | AuthenticationInterceptor exists, but no tests for JWT validation, token expiration, permission enforcement |
| **Caching Layer** | INCOMPLETE | `AudioVideoCache` wraps platform cache, but no tests for TTL, invalidation on delete, multi-tenant isolation |
| **Messaging** | INCOMPLETE | Producer/Consumer exist but no integration tests with RabbitMQ or queue verification |
| **Speech (STT)** | STUB | `WhisperTranscriptionEngine` throws `UnsupportedOperationException`; LLM fallback is only path |
| **Speech (TTS)** | UNKNOWN | Module exists but not audited in depth |
| **Vision** | PARTIAL | OpenCV + YOLO wired up, tests exist, but model evaluation/versioning/fallback missing |
| **Desktop App** | INCOMPLETE | Tauri + React UI structure present, but E2E tests and API contracts undefined |
| **TypeScript Libs** | INCOMPLETE | `audio-video-types`, `audio-video-client`, `audio-video-ui` packages exist, schema validation missing |

## 2. Per-Module Deep Audit

### 2.1 `modules/speech/stt-service`

**Intent:** Provide Speech-to-Text (STT) transcription via gRPC API; support Whisper ONNX, diarization, custom vocabulary, and streaming.

**What Exists:**
- `SttGrpcServer` — Standalone gRPC server binding on port 50051
- `SttGrpcService` — gRPC service implementation
- `WhisperTranscriptionEngine` — **DEPRECATED stub** (throws `UnsupportedOperationException`)
- `SpeakerDiarizationService` — Diarization logic
- `CustomVocabularyManager` — Custom vocabulary injection
- `SttStreamingLatencyEnhancer` — Streaming optimization
- Build system: Java 21, gRPC, protobuf, platform security/observability

**Completeness Assessment:**

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Transcription | INCOMPLETE | `WhisperTranscriptionEngine.transcribe()` throws exception; LLM fallback required |
| Diarization | UNKNOWN | Class exists but integration with transcription unclear |
| Custom vocabulary | UNKNOWN | Manager exists but no tests for vocabulary injection |
| Streaming | UNKNOWN | `SttStreamingLatencyEnhancer` exists but not integrated with gRPC streaming |
| Error handling | PARTIAL | Validation on audio format/size, but no comprehensive error taxonomy |
| Multi-tenancy | PARTIAL | Platform security interceptor present, but not tested |
| Observability | PARTIAL | `SimpleMeterRegistry` used; no structured logging for transcription flow |

**Correctness Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **Whisper Engine is Not Implemented** — Core transcription logic throws `UnsupportedOperationException`. This is fine if documented and LLM fallback is enforced, but:
   - No test validates that fallback is used
   - No graceful error handling if LLM service unreachable
   - Code comments suggest ONNX/JNI "not yet available" without timeline

2. ⚠️ **Diarization Stubs** — `diarize()` method in `WhisperTranscriptionEngine` returns hard-coded single speaker segment (5 seconds), not actual diarization.

3. ⚠️ **Language Detection Stub** — `detectLanguage()` uses `text.hashCode() % langs.length` heuristic, not actual ML model.

**Test Gaps:**

- ❌ No test for E2E transcription: audio input → gRPC → result
- ❌ No test for auth: verify tenant in context matches request
- ❌ No test for streaming: test gRPC streaming endpoint if implemented
- ❌ No test for error: invalid audio format, timeout, service unavailable
- ❌ No test for custom vocabulary injection
- ❌ No latency benchmark

**Production Readiness: FAIL**

Rationale: Core functionality (transcription) is not implemented. LLM fallback must be the documented, tested, and enforced path. Without that, this is a stub service.

---

### 2.2 `modules/vision/vision-service`

**Intent:** Provide computer vision capabilities (object detection, OCR, scene understanding, facial recognition) via gRPC API.

**What Exists:**
- `VisionGrpcServer` — Standalone gRPC server on port 50054
- `VisionGrpcService` — gRPC service implementation
- `VisionModelEngine` — Core ML model engine (OpenCV + YOLO)
- `OcrService` — OCR text extraction
- `SceneUnderstandingService` — Scene analysis
- `FacialRecognitionService` — Face detection/recognition
- `YoloV8Adapter` — YOLO v8 model adapter
- `VideoAnalysisService` — Multi-frame analysis
- `VideoFrameExtractor` — Video to frame extraction
- `DetectionConfigTest`, `BoundingBoxTest`, etc. — Unit tests exist
- Build: Java 21, OpenCV 4.9.0, gRPC, protobuf

**Completeness Assessment:**

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Object Detection | PARTIAL | YOLO adapter exists, inference engine present, but model versioning missing |
| OCR | PARTIAL | Service exists, integration unclear |
| Scene Understanding | UNKNOWN | Service exists but not audited |
| Facial Recognition | UNKNOWN | Service exists but privacy implications not documented |
| Model Evaluation | MISSING | No accuracy metrics (mAP, precision, recall), no confidence thresholds |
| Fallback behavior | MISSING | No graceful degradation under load or model failure |
| Video processing | PARTIAL | Frame extractor exists but processing pipeline not end-to-end tested |

**Correctness Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **Model Versioning Missing** — `VisionModelEngine` loads YOLO but no version pinning or A/B testing support.

2. ⚠️ **Confidence Threshold Not Enforced** — Detection results returned without filtering by confidence. Downstream code must validate (should be here).

3. ⚠️ **Facial Recognition Privacy Risk** — Service exists but no documentation on:
   - GDPR/CCPA compliance for face storage
   - Consent validation
   - Data retention policy
   - Audit logging

4. ⚠️ **Inference Latency Unpredictable** — No performance tests for model inference time under concurrent requests.

**Test Gaps:**

- ❌ No E2E test: video upload → frame extraction → object detection → results
- ❌ No model accuracy evaluation (need labeled dataset, compute mAP/precision/recall)
- ❌ No confidence threshold test (verify filtered detections)
- ❌ No fallback test (model unavailable → return cached/simplified result)
- ❌ No privacy test for facial recognition (consent validation, audit logging)
- ❌ No performance test: inference latency, concurrency under load
- ❌ No test for video format diversity (MP4, AVI, WebM, etc.)

**Production Readiness: PARTIAL / NOT READY**

Rationale: Core functionality exists but lacks:
1. Model evaluation/metrics (cannot validate accuracy)
2. Fallback behavior (no resilience)
3. Privacy controls (facial recognition not production-safe)
4. Performance validation (latency untested)

---

### 2.3 `modules/infrastructure/persistence`

**Intent:** Provide JPA-based persistence with tenant isolation, soft delete, async service layer wrapping.

**What Exists:**
- `AudioFileEntity` — JPA entity with soft delete, JSONB metadata, versioning
- `TranscriptionEntity` — JPA entity for transcription results
- `JpaAudioFileRepository` — Synchronous repository (per AEP pattern)
- `JpaTranscriptionRepository` — Synchronous repository
- `AudioFileService` — Async service wrapping repository via `Promise.ofBlocking()`
- `TranscriptionService` — Async service
- Flyway migration: `V1__init_schema.sql` with soft delete columns
- Tests: `JpaAudioFileRepositoryTest`, `JpaTranscriptionRepositoryTest`, `PersistenceIntegrationTest`

**Completeness Assessment:**

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| CRUD Operations | COMPLETE | All basic operations present |
| Soft Delete | PARTIAL | Columns exist, `softDelete()` method present, but not all queries filter `deleted=false` |
| Tenant Isolation | COMPLETE | All named queries filter by `tenantId` |
| Optimistic Locking | COMPLETE | `@Version` column present in entities |
| Async Service Wrapping | COMPLETE | `Promise.ofBlocking()` pattern implemented |
| Named Queries | COMPLETE | Well-defined for common access patterns |
| Transaction Handling | PARTIAL | Repository manages transactions, but no rollback test |

**Correctness Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **Soft Delete Not Universally Applied** — Named query `findByTenantId` filters `deleted=false`, but `findByUserIdAndTenantId` does NOT check deletion flag:
   ```java
   @NamedQuery(
       name = "AudioFile.findByUserIdAndTenantId",
       query = "SELECT af FROM AudioFileEntity af WHERE af.userId = :userId AND af.tenantId = :tenantId"
       // Missing: AND af.deleted = false
   )
   ```

2. ⚠️ **No Test for Soft Delete Correctness** — `softDelete()` method sets `deleted=true`, but no test verifies that soft-deleted records are not returned by queries.

3. ⚠️ **Transaction Isolation Not Tested** — Repository uses `EntityManager` with manual transaction handling, but no test for concurrent updates or serialization issues.

4. ⚠️ **Versioning Collisions Not Handled** — `@Version` is present, but optimistic lock exception handling not tested.

**Test Gaps:**

- ❌ No test for soft delete correctness (verify query excludes deleted records)
- ❌ No test for concurrent update (optimistic lock exception → retry)
- ❌ No test for transaction rollback (partial failure scenario)
- ❌ No test for bulk operations (performance, index efficacy)
- ❌ No test for data migration/schema compatibility
- ❌ No test for connection pool exhaustion
- ❌ No test for query timeout behavior

**Production Readiness: PASS WITH MINOR GAPS**

Rationale: Core persistence works, follows AEP pattern, but soft delete not fully validated. Recommend adding:
1. Test for soft delete query correctness
2. Concurrency test for optimistic locking
3. Performance test for bulk operations

---

### 2.4 `modules/infrastructure/security`

**Intent:** Provide gRPC authentication interceptor with JWT validation and tenant context propagation.

**What Exists:**
- `AuthenticationInterceptor` — gRPC server interceptor implementing `ServerInterceptor`
- Dependencies: platform:java:security (JWT provider)

**Completeness Assessment:**

Very minimal. Single file with core logic.

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| JWT Validation | UNKNOWN | Uses platform `AuthenticationProvider`, but no test |
| Token Expiration | UNKNOWN | Assumed handled by platform, but not tested |
| Tenant Context Propagation | UNKNOWN | Should propagate to thread local, but no test |
| Authorization (RBAC) | MISSING | Interceptor validates presence of token, not permissions |
| Token Refresh | MISSING | No refresh token support documented |

**Correctness Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **No Tests for Interceptor** — Cannot verify:
   - Invalid token → 401 response
   - Expired token → 401 response
   - Valid token → tenant context set correctly
   - Missing token → 401 response

2. ⚠️ **Tenant Extraction Logic Unclear** — No code shown for how tenant ID is extracted from JWT claims.

3. ⚠️ **No Authorization Layer** — Interceptor validates authentication but not authorization. Each service must check permissions manually (error-prone).

**Test Gaps:**

- ❌ No test for invalid JWT → 401 response
- ❌ No test for expired JWT → 401 response
- ❌ No test for valid JWT → tenant context propagation
- ❌ No test for missing authorization header → 401 response
- ❌ No test for malformed JWT
- ❌ No integration test with actual gRPC service

**Production Readiness: FAIL**

Rationale: Core security interceptor exists but completely untested. Cannot deploy without:
1. Unit tests for all auth paths
2. Integration test with gRPC service
3. Documented authorization mechanism per endpoint

---

### 2.5 `modules/infrastructure/cache`

**Intent:** Wrap platform cache abstraction with audio-video-specific key namespacing and default TTLs.

**What Exists:**
- `AudioVideoCache` — Wrapper around `platform:java:database` cache port
- `TranscriptionCacheService` — Higher-level caching service
- Dependencies: platform:java:database

**Completeness Assessment:**

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Key Namespacing | PARTIAL | Wrapper exists but no test for namespace isolation |
| TTL Management | UNKNOWN | Default TTLs likely set, but no test |
| Invalidation | MISSING | No test for cache invalidation on soft delete |
| Multi-tenant Isolation | UNKNOWN | Should use tenant ID in key, but not tested |

**Correctness Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **No Tests for Cache Behavior** — Cannot verify:
   - Key namespacing prevents cross-tenant leakage
   - TTL expiration works
   - Invalidation on delete

2. ⚠️ **Invalidation Strategy Unclear** — If audio file is soft-deleted, should associated transcription cache entries be invalidated? Not documented.

**Test Gaps:**

- ❌ No test for key namespace isolation (same key, different tenants)
- ❌ No test for TTL expiration
- ❌ No test for invalidation on soft delete
- ❌ No integration test with Redis
- ❌ No performance test for cache hit rate

**Production Readiness: INCOMPLETE**

Rationale: Cache wrapper exists but untested. Must add comprehensive cache tests before production.

---

### 2.6 `modules/infrastructure/messaging`

**Intent:** Provide async job producer/consumer for transcription requests via RabbitMQ.

**What Exists:**
- `TranscriptionJobProducer` — Produces transcription jobs to queue
- `TranscriptionJobConsumer` — Consumes and processes jobs
- Dependencies: platform:java:messaging (queue strategies)
- Jackson JSON serialization

**Completeness Assessment:**

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Job Serialization | COMPLETE | Jackson used (proper, not string formatting) |
| Job Production | UNKNOWN | Producer exists but no test |
| Job Consumption | UNKNOWN | Consumer exists but no test |
| Idempotency | MISSING | No test for reprocessing same job |
| Retry Logic | MISSING | No test for retry behavior |
| Dead Letter | MISSING | No test for poison pill handling |

**Correctness Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **No Integration Tests** — Cannot verify:
   - Job serializes/deserializes correctly
   - Producer successfully enqueues to RabbitMQ
   - Consumer dequeues and processes
   - Failed job goes to DLQ

2. ⚠️ **Idempotency Not Enforced** — If same job processed twice, what happens? No guards.

**Test Gaps:**

- ❌ No integration test with RabbitMQ (Testcontainers)
- ❌ No test for job idempotency
- ❌ No test for retry on temporary failure
- ❌ No test for poison pill (unparseable message)
- ❌ No test for message ordering
- ❌ No performance test for throughput

**Production Readiness: INCOMPLETE**

Rationale: Queue adapter exists but untested. Cannot deploy without integration tests with actual RabbitMQ.

---

### 2.7 `modules/intelligence/multimodal-service`

**Intent:** Unclear. Module exists but functionality not documented.

**What Exists:**
- `build.gradle.kts` present
- Likely integrates speech + vision + other modalities

**Completeness Assessment:** UNKNOWN — requires deeper exploration.

**Test Gaps:** Entire module untested (no visibility into implementation).

**Production Readiness: UNKNOWN / LIKELY INCOMPLETE**

Recommendation: Audit this module separately. Appears to be integration point but lacks documentation.

---

### 2.8 `apps/desktop` (Tauri + React)

**Intent:** Unified desktop application for audio-video workflows (record, transcribe, analyze, playback).

**What Exists:**
- React 19 app with Vite + Tailwind
- Tauri 2 bridge to OS APIs
- Playwright E2E testing configured
- Dependencies: `@ghatana/design-system`, `@audio-video/client`, `@audio-video/types`, `@audio-video/ui`
- State: Jotai atoms
- Routing: React Router DOM

**Completeness Assessment:**

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| UI Components | UNKNOWN | No code visibility |
| State Management | UNKNOWN | Jotai configured but not audited |
| API Integration | UNKNOWN | Depends on `@audio-video/client` |
| Error Handling | UNKNOWN | No visible error boundaries |
| Offline Support | UNKNOWN | Tauri capable but not documented |

**Correctness Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **No E2E Tests** — Playwright configured but no documented test scenarios.

2. ⚠️ **No API Contracts** — Desktop app depends on backend services but no schema validation or contract tests.

**Test Gaps:**

- ❌ No E2E test for record → transcribe → playback workflow
- ❌ No test for network failure handling
- ❌ No test for auth timeout + re-login
- ❌ No test for permission denied scenarios
- ❌ No accessibility testing
- ❌ No performance profiling

**Production Readiness: INCOMPLETE**

Rationale: Structured present but E2E scenarios and error handling untested.

---

### 2.9 `libs/audio-video-types` (TypeScript)

**Intent:** Shared TypeScript type definitions for audio-video domain.

**What Exists:**
- `package.json` with vitest configured
- `src/index.ts` exports types
- `__tests__/types.contract.test.ts` — shallow contract test

**Completeness Assessment:**

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Type Definitions | UNKNOWN | `index.d.ts` exists but not reviewed |
| Schema Validation | MISSING | No Zod schemas for runtime validation |
| Contract Tests | SHALLOW | Single test file found |

**Correctness Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **No Runtime Validation** — Types exist for TypeScript but no Zod schemas to validate API responses at runtime.

**Test Gaps:**

- ❌ No comprehensive type coverage test
- ❌ No schema validation test
- ❌ No contract test validating backend responses match types

**Production Readiness: INCOMPLETE**

Rationale: TypeScript types exist but no runtime validation. Must add Zod schemas for API boundaries.

---

### 2.10 `libs/audio-video-client` (TypeScript)

**Intent:** gRPC/HTTP client for audio-video services.

**What Exists:**
- `package.json` with vitest
- `src/index.ts` exports client
- `__tests__/AudioVideoClient.test.ts` — exists but not reviewed

**Completeness Assessment:**

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Service Connections | UNKNOWN | Likely connects to STT, Vision, etc. |
| Retry Logic | UNKNOWN | Not visible |
| Timeout Handling | UNKNOWN | Not visible |
| Multi-tenant Support | UNKNOWN | Should propagate tenant header |

**Correctness Issues:**

1. ⚠️ **Backend contract coverage still partial** — Client-side retries/timeouts and boundary validation are tested, but full cross-service contract coverage remains incomplete.

2. ⚠️ **Tenant propagation now client-supported** — `ServiceClientConfig` can propagate `X-Tenant-Id`; server-side enforcement remains the system-level gate.

**Test Gaps:**

- ✅ Retry logic covered in client tests
- ✅ Timeout handling covered in client tests
- ✅ Tenant header propagation covered in client tests
- ✅ Client-to-service HTTP integration path covered for request headers
- ❌ No integration test with actual gRPC services

**Production Readiness: INCOMPLETE**

**Intent:** Reusable React components for audio-video workflows (record, transcribe, analyze).

**What Exists:**
- `package.json` with vitest
- Hooks: `useSpeechRecognition`, etc.

**Completeness Assessment:** Limited visibility; requires deeper review.

**Test Gaps:**

- ❌ No component snapshot/render tests
- ❌ No tests for hooks
- ❌ No accessibility tests
- ❌ No error state tests

**Production Readiness: INCOMPLETE**

---

### 2.12 `libs/common` (Java)

**Intent:** Shared Java utilities for audio-video services.

**What Exists:**
- `build.gradle.kts` present
- Likely contains `AudioVideoGrpcServerBase`, security interceptors, etc.

**Completeness Assessment:** Requires deeper review.

## 6. Technology & Architecture Assessment

### Strengths

1. ✅ **Polyglot Build Well-Coordinated** — Java/Gradle, TypeScript/PNPM, Rust/Cargo integrated cleanly
2. ✅ **Platform Reuse Correct** — Uses `platform:java:*` modules appropriately
3. ✅ **Persistence Pattern Sound** — Sync repos + async services (AEP pattern) properly applied
4. ✅ **Tenant Isolation at SQL Layer** — Secure by default
5. ✅ **Infrastructure Separation** — Persistence, security, cache, messaging modularized

### Weaknesses

1. ❌ **Core STT Implementation Stub** — Whisper engine not functional; LLM fallback undocumented
2. ❌ **Vision Model Lacks Safety Controls** — No confidence thresholds, model versioning, or fallback
3. ❌ **Missing Integration Testing Framework** — No clear patterns for cross-module tests
4. ❌ **Incomplete Observability** — `SimpleMeterRegistry` insufficient for production; no structured logging
5. ❌ **TypeScript Runtime Validation Missing** — Types exist but no Zod schemas at boundaries
6. ❌ **Messaging Design Underspecified** — No documented idempotency or DLQ strategy

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Formalize STT Architecture Decision**
   - Document that Whisper is deprecated
   - Enforce LLM fallback as only path
   - Define SLA for LLM service

2. **Add Model Management Framework**
   - Version all ML models
   - Support A/B testing
   - Track accuracy metrics

3. **Standardize Integration Testing**
   - Testcontainers for all external dependencies
   - Clear patterns for cross-module tests

4. **Implement Production Observability**
   - Replace `SimpleMeterRegistry` with Micrometer + Prometheus
   - Structured logging with SLF4J + JSON
   - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry

5. **Add Runtime Type Safety**
   - Zod schemas for all APIs
   - Contract tests in CI

---

## 7. AI/ML Readiness Assessment

### Speech-to-Text

**Current State:** Stub implementation with LLM fallback only
- ❌ No Whisper model integration
- ⚠️ LLM fallback undocumented
- ❌ No evaluation metrics (WER, CER)
- ❌ No fallback to lower-quality model under load

**Recommendations:**
1. Document LLM fallback as *intentional architecture*, not temporary
2. Implement Whisper as optional enhancement (if needed)
3. Add WER evaluation on test dataset
4. Implement graceful fallback to cached results if LLM unavailable

### Vision (Object Detection, OCR, Face Recognition)

**Current State:** OpenCV + YOLO partially integrated
- ⚠️ Model exists but confidence threshold not enforced
- ❌ No accuracy evaluation (mAP not measured)
- ❌ Facial recognition privacy risks (no consent, no audit)
- ❌ No fallback to lower-accuracy model under load

**Recommendations:**
1. **Evaluate model accuracy** — Compute mAP on labeled test set; target ≥0.75
2. **Enforce confidence threshold** — Filter detections < 0.5 confidence
3. **Implement privacy controls** — Gated facial recognition behind consent + audit log
4. **Add fallback strategy** — Under load or if model confidence low, return simplified result
5. **Version models** — Pin YOLO version; support A/B testing
6. **Measure drift** — Monitor accuracy over time

### Multimodal Integration

**Current State:** Module exists but undefined
- ❌ No documented API contracts
- ❌ No integration logic visible
- ❌ No tests

**Recommendations:**
1. Document expected multimodal use cases (e.g., video with audio analysis)
2. Define API contracts
3. Implement integration tests

---

## 8. Observability & Operations Assessment

### Current State

- ⚠️ `SimpleMeterRegistry` — Metrics stored in memory, lost on restart
- ❌ No structured logging for business flows
- ❌ No distributed tracing
- ❌ No health check endpoints
- ❌ No audit trails for data access

### Required Improvements

1. **Metrics:** Implement Micrometer + Prometheus exporter
   - Request latency histograms
   - Error rate counters
   - Business KPIs (transcription count, model inference time)

2. **Logging:** Structured logging via SLF4J + JSON
   - All gRPC requests logged
   - Database operations with latency
   - Error stack traces

3. **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry integration
   - gRPC request spans
   - Database query spans
   - Cross-service call tracing

4. **Health:** Readiness/liveness endpoints
   - Database connectivity
   - Cache connectivity
   - Messaging connectivity

5. **Audit:** Log all data access
   - User ID, tenant ID, resource ID
   - Timestamp, operation, result

---

## 9. Security & Privacy Assessment

### Authentication & Authorization

- ✅ JWT validation via platform:java:security
- ❌ No test coverage
- ⚠️ Authorization layer missing (per-endpoint permissions not checked)

### Data Protection

- ✅ Tenant isolation at SQL layer
- ⚠️ Soft delete prevents accidental leakage
- ❌ No encryption at rest or in transit (assume TLS via deployment)
- ❌ No secrets management (assume handled via deployment)

### Privacy

- ❌ **Facial recognition risks** — No consent validation, audit logging, or retention policy
- ⚠️ Audio/video data handling policy not documented
- ❌ No GDPR/CCPA compliance controls

### Recommendations

1. **Add auth tests** — 401 for missing/expired tokens
2. **Implement authorization** — Per-endpoint permission checks
3. **Facial recognition gating** — Require explicit feature flag + user consent
4. **Audit logging** — All face recognition calls logged
5. **Retention policy** — Auto-delete old audio/video files (configurable)
6. **Encryption** — TLS for transit, encryption at rest if storing sensitive data
7. **Compliance** — Document GDPR/CCPA posture

## 10. Glossary of Issues

### Test Coverage Terminology

- **Line Coverage** — Percentage of source lines executed by tests (not sufficient alone)
- **Branch Coverage** — Percentage of decision branches taken (better, but still incomplete)
- **Feature Coverage** — Percentage of documented features tested (required for completeness)
- **Flow Coverage** — Percentage of user workflows tested end-to-end (required for E2E)
- **Contract Coverage** — Percentage of API requests/responses validated (required for integration)
- **Meaningful Coverage** — Coverage that validates business behavior, not just code execution (required for production)

## 13. Recommendations: Prioritized Action Plan

### Immediate (Week 1)

1. ✋ **STOP shipping WhisperTranscriptionEngine stub** — Document LLM fallback as intentional
2. ✋ **STOP shipping untested auth interceptor** — Add JWT validation tests before merge
3. ✋ **Fix soft delete query** — `findByUserIdAndTenantId` missing `AND af.deleted = false`

### Short-term (Weeks 2-3)

4. 🧪 Add security interceptor tests (JWT valid/expired/invalid/missing)
5. 🧪 Add persistence tests (soft delete, concurrency, rollback)
6. 🧪 Add messaging integration tests (Testcontainers + RabbitMQ)
7. 📋 Document multimodal service API contracts
8. 🔒 Implement facial recognition consent + audit logging

### Medium-term (Weeks 4-6)

9. 🧪 Add gRPC E2E tests (all services)
10. 🧪 Add desktop app E2E scenarios (Playwright)
11. 🧪 Add performance benchmarks
12. 📊 Implement observability (metrics/logging/tracing)
13. ✅ Add TypeScript runtime validation (Zod schemas)

### Long-term (Post-GA)

14. 🤖 Implement vision model evaluation (mAP on test set)
15. 🚀 Optimize inference latency
16. 📈 Add advanced monitoring/alerting

---

## 14. Conclusion

The Audio-Video product has a solid architectural foundation with clean boundaries, proper platform reuse, and good infrastructure layering. However, it is **not production-ready** without addressing critical gaps:

1. **Core STT implementation is a stub** — LLM fallback must be enforced and tested
2. **Security is untested** — Authentication interceptor lacks test coverage
3. **Integration testing is missing** — Cross-module flows not validated
4. **Observability is insufficient** — Production monitoring infrastructure needed
5. **Privacy controls are incomplete** — Facial recognition uncontrolled

By executing the action plan in Section 13, the product can reach production-readiness in 6-8 weeks. Recommend prioritizing P0 blockers (2 weeks) before any deployment.
