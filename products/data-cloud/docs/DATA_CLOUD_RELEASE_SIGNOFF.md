# Data-Cloud Release Sign-Off Packet

> Status: Ready for stakeholder approval
> Prepared on: 2026-03-24
> Scope: Sprint 6 release readiness, go/no-go evidence, approval checklist

## Purpose

This packet consolidates the engineering evidence required for final Data-Cloud release approval by Architecture, Security, AI Governance, and Product Steering.

## Engineering Evidence

| Area | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Targeted backend validation | `./gradlew :products:data-cloud:launcher:compileJava :products:data-cloud:platform:compileJava` | ✅ Green on 2026-03-24 |
| Targeted launcher tests | `./gradlew :products:data-cloud:launcher:test` | ✅ Green on 2026-03-24 |
| Contract drift gate | `products/data-cloud/scripts/check-openapi-drift.sh` + `sdk-generation` CI job | ✅ In CI |
| Reuse gate | `products/data-cloud/scripts/check-reuse-scorecard.sh` + `reuse-scorecard` CI job | ✅ In CI |
| Backup/restore drill automation | `products/data-cloud/scripts/run-backup-drill.sh` + `backup-drill` CI job | ✅ In CI |
| Smoke validation automation | `products/data-cloud/scripts/run-smoke-e2e.sh` + `smoke-e2e` CI job | ✅ In CI |
| Helm / manifest validation | `.github/workflows/data-cloud-ci.yml` `helm-render-validation` job | ✅ Corrected to the real chart path |
| Canary / rollback procedure | `products/data-cloud/docs/CANARY_ROLLOUT_PLAYBOOK.md` | ✅ Active |

## Approval Matrix

| Approval stream | Required evidence | Approval status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Module boundary ADR, ArchUnit tests, structural simplification packet | ⬜ Pending | Review `DATA_CLOUD_STRUCTURAL_SIMPLIFICATION_SIGNOFF.md` |
| Security | Endpoint sensitivity coverage, audit emission, backup drill, release gate | ⬜ Pending | Confirm current control posture and residual risk |
| AI Governance | AI journey coverage, recommendation metrics, fallback behavior, voice safety controls | ⬜ Pending | Confirm confidence thresholds and fallback policy |
| Product Steering | Release gate status, canary plan, rollback path, known external dependencies | ⬜ Pending | Final go/no-go approval |

## Remaining External Actions

1. Execute one live staging smoke run with `DC_STAGING_BASE_URL`, `DC_SMOKE_TENANT_ID`, and `DC_SMOKE_API_TOKEN` populated in CI.
2. Attach the latest successful `data-cloud-ci.yml` run URL to the deployment record.
3. Record approvals from Architecture, Security, AI Governance, and Product Steering in the release ticket or deployment PR.

## Known Residuals

1. The staging parity gate is automation-ready but still depends on environment variables and deploy-time credentials.
2. `backup-drill` and `smoke-e2e` remain advisory in CI by design; hard enforcement requires live environment configuration.
